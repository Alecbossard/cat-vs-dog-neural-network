Cat vs. Dog Classification from Scratch 🐱🐶

This project implements several neural network models from the ground up using only NumPy. The goal is to classify images of cats and dogs, demonstrating the core mechanics of deep learning without high-level frameworks like TensorFlow or Keras. The code progresses from a simple single-neuron model to a flexible deep neural network.
